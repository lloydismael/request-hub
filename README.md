## Features

### 📝 Request Management
- Create requests with reference codes, priority (Medium / High), engagement type, and product category
- Assign primary and backup engineers with capacity enforcement (max 5 ongoing; max 3 when a deployment is active)
- SLA due-date auto-calculation (Medium = 5 days, High = 3 days)
- Overdue detection and visual indicators on the dashboard
- Status log history and admin-authored request updates

### 📊 Dashboard & Reporting
- **Admin/PM dashboard**: filterable, sortable request table with stat pills (All / Ongoing / Completed / Overdue)
- **Engineer dashboard**: Assigned vs Backup tabs, personal activity report graph
- **Requestor dashboard**: personal metrics, request creation, and progress tracking
- **Reports page (Operational)**: stacked bar charts requests by requestor, by engineer, by engagement type, by product category
- **Reports page (Activity)**: billable vs non-billable hours, work location mix (donut), activity type breakdown, paginated engineer log
- Chart **expand button** on every chart card for full-screen view

### 🔔 Notifications & Communication
- In-app notification center for assignment events and workflow changes
- Communication action log (Teams, Outlook, Phone) with channel tagging
- Optional Teams chat topic field per request

### 🧾 SQR (Service Quotation Request)
- Engineers and reviewers manage SQR entries directly from the tracker
- Tracks quotation details, SSE/PM man-hours, managed support amount, discounting, approval metadata, and revenue fields
- Status labels in the tracker:
      - `submitted` ? **For Processing**
      - `for_revision` ? **For Revision**
      - `reviewed` ? **Approved**
- Approved flow supports two user options:
      - open a ready-to-edit email draft through the local mail app
      - download a formatted `.eml` file with the branded quotation layout
- Managed support date behavior:
      - `AI` = Post-service warranty end date
      - `AJ` = Support start date (manual value or computed fallback)
      - `AK` = Support end date (`AJ + 365 days`)
      - `AJ` and `AK` show `NA` when column `P` has no managed support value

### 👤 User & Profile Management
- Profile photos stored in the database (no external media bucket required)
- Configurable banner gradient (Blue, Sunset, Forest, Crimson, Slate, Aurora, Rose, Teal)
- Forced password-change on first login or admin reset
- Microsoft Graph user sync via `fetch_phildata_users` management command

## Workflow

```
Create  ──────▶  Review & Assign  ──────▶  Acknowledge  ──────▶  Work  ──────▶  Complete  ──────▶  SQR
(requestor       (Admin / PM-ESG:          (engineer      (assigned tab:          (end_date   (post-engagement
 roles:           engineer + due date,      confirms       log activity,           set,        quotation + revenue
 requestor,       lifecycle                assignment)     comms via               lifecycle     tracking, submitted

 PM-ESS,
 PM-ESG)
```

- **SLA** is auto-calculated at assignment (Medium = 5 days, High = 3 days); `check_sla` flags overdue daily.
- **Assignment capacity**: max 5 ongoing per engineer; max 3 while a deployment is active.
- **Status updates** are recorded on every save (StatusLog) and notify assignees; completion is restricted to Admin / PM-ESG and the assigned engineer.

## Local Development

### 1. Create virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Fill placeholders only. Never put application login usernames or passwords in .env.
```

### 3. Apply migrations & run

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

---

## Docker Setup

### Pull and run from Docker Hub

```powershell
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 --env-file .env lloydismael12/request-hub:v50.7
```

### Build locally

```powershell
$containers = docker ps --format "{{.ID}} {{.Ports}}" | Where-Object { $_ -match "0\.0\.0\.0:8000->8000/tcp|:::8000->8000/tcp" }
$containers | ForEach-Object { docker rm -f (($_ -split ' ')[0]) }
docker build --pull --no-cache --build-arg APP_VERSION=v50.7 -t lloydismael12/request-hub:v50.7 .
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 --env-file .env -e APP_VERSION=v50.7 lloydismael12/request-hub:v50.7
```

### Push to Docker Hub

```powershell
docker push lloydismael12/request-hub:v50.7
# Do not retag or push latest until CVE scans on v50.7 are clean.
```

### Compose (with local PostgreSQL)

```powershell
docker compose up --build
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

> If you are running the image on another machine, make sure the `.env` file exists on that machine and the `--env-file` path points to the correct local file.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key. Required when `DJANGO_DEBUG` is `False`; must not be empty or `insecure-development-key`. |
| `DJANGO_DEBUG` | `True` for local HTTP development, `False` for production (fail-closed). |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated allowed host names |
| `DB_NAME` | PostgreSQL database name |
| `DB_USER` | Database username. Required when `DJANGO_DEBUG` is `False`. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password. Required when `DJANGO_DEBUG` is `False`. |
| `DB_HOST` | Database host (e.g. Azure PostgreSQL hostname). Required when `DJANGO_DEBUG` is `False`. |
| `DB_PORT` | Database port (default `5432`) |
| `ACS_EMAIL_CONNECTION_STRING` | Azure Communication Services connection string |
| `ACS_EMAIL_SENDER` | ACS sender address |
| `PHILDATA_TENANT_ID` | Microsoft Entra tenant ID |
| `PHILDATA_CLIENT_ID` | App registration client ID |
| `PHILDATA_CLIENT_SECRET` | App registration client secret |
| `PHILDATA_DOMAIN` | Default company domain (see `.env.example`) |
| `PHILDATA_GRAPH_SCOPE` | Default `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` |

> Never commit real secrets, tokens, passwords, or connection strings to source control.

> Application login usernames and passwords must not be stored in `.env`. Admin password resets issue a one-time temporary password instead of a shared default. `DJANGO_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD` is rejected if present.

> `.env.example` is the only committed template. Copy it to `.env` (gitignored and dockerignored) and fill values locally or in Azure App Service / Key Vault.

---

## Database & Migrations

```powershell
# Apply all pending migrations
python manage.py migrate

# After model changes
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Inspect current state
python manage.py showmigrations
```

---

## Scheduled Jobs

### SLA Monitoring (run daily)

```powershell
# Local
python manage.py check_sla

# Docker
docker compose exec web python manage.py check_sla
```

Schedule with Windows Task Scheduler, Linux `cron`, or Azure Container Apps scheduled jobs.

### Microsoft Graph User Sync

```powershell
# Fetch up to 25 users, sample 10
python manage.py fetch_phildata_users --limit 25 --sample 10

# Include all users (not only the default company domain)
python manage.py fetch_phildata_users --include-non-domain
```

---

## Deployment

Full Azure App Service container deployment guide:

[docs/azure-app-service-deployment.md](docs/azure-app-service-deployment.md)

**Key steps:**
1. Push image to Docker Hub (`lloydismael12/request-hub:v50.7` or your next release tag). Do not retag `latest` until scans are clean.
2. Set App Service container to the target tag
3. Configure all environment variables in App Service Configuration (`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` are required when `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`)
4. Ensure Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server firewall allows the App Service outbound IPs
5. Run migrations via the App Service console or a startup script

---

## Security

- Store Django, database, ACS, and Graph secrets in `.env` or Azure App Service / Key Vault, never in source, HTML, or image layers
- `.env` is gitignored and dockerignored; only `.env.example` (empty placeholders) is committed
- Rotate any exposed credentials immediately
- Production boot is fail-closed: missing `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, or `DB_PASSWORD` refuses to start when `DJANGO_DEBUG` is false
- Login failures are throttled at 5 attempts / 15 minutes per IP+username
- Database media files are served only under the `profile_photos/` prefix; other prefixes 404
- Admin password reset issues a one-time temporary password and sets `must_change_password`
- `PasswordChangeRequiredMiddleware` enforces password rotation on flagged accounts
- `ProfileCompletionMiddleware` blocks access until profile fields are filled
- All role checks are enforced server-side via `LoginRequiredMixin` + custom role mixins
- PostgreSQL connections use SSL in production (enforced by Azure Flexible Server)
- Static files served by WhiteNoise, no user-uploaded files exposed via the filesystem
- `GET /healthz/` returns `ok` for container probes without authentication
